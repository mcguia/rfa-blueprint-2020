Using the Strategies in this Blueprint will help state leaders shift away from making spending decisions based on assumptions and towards spending resources on activities that have (or are building) evidence of effectiveness.

Leveraging both lead and lag metrics, the state reviewed its performance quarterly at the cabinet level, which informed cross-department collaboration on major initiatives. This effort was launched by the state’s first Chief Performance Officer, appointed in 2015, and expanded that same year when the new Lieutenant Governor assumed role of Chief Operating Officer with operational responsibility for a state government budget of more than $30 billion and a 30,000 person workforce. Over three years, the state improved on 85% of its metrics and hit the target on 55%. For example, as noted in the Governor’s November 2018 budget request, the state expanded broadband connectivity for school districts from 74% in 2015 to 98% in 2018, lowered the healthcare uninsured rate from 14% in 2013 to 6.5% in 2017, and cut or modified half of the state’s 24,500 regulations, delivering more than $7.9 million in cost avoidance and 2.3 million in hours saved for Colorado businesses in 2017. Given the success of these efforts, the <a href="https://dashboard.state.co.us/">public dashboard</a> was maintained across a change in Administration in 2019. The state also established <a href="https://coloradolab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Report-5-Lean-Process-Improvement.11.1.19.pdf">process improvement resources and teams</a> that led to the completion of nearly 900 projects over seven years, touching every state agency.

During this period, the Governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting increased the use of data and evidence in budget decisions by <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TNL0CtD9wXOXozbkMzUlZwZHc/view">requiring agencies</a> to include the following in their budget requests: evidence of program effectiveness, alignment with the Governor’s dashboard metrics, and if they had been the focus of a process improvement project. The Governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting has partnered with state agencies, academic and philanthropic organizations, and the state legislature’s Joint Budget Committee as part of an <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/ebp_12-11-2018.pdf">Evidence-Based Policy Collaborative</a> to “use the best available research and information to help guide and inform policy and budget decisions” for the state’s budget of more than $30 billion.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row examples-grid__content-row criteria"><!-- content columns  --><div class="column examples-grid-column examples-grid__content-cell themes light-green text-center" onclick="window.location='/rfa-blueprint-2020/theme/investing-for-results.html';"><div class="theme-link" href="/rfa-blueprint-2020/theme/investing-for-results.html">Investing for Results</div><img class="theme-img" alt="Roadmap" src="/"></div><div class="column examples-grid-column examples-grid__content-cell strategies light-green filterable"><div class="examples-wrapper leading-example"><div class="row"><div class="description column large-12"><p>Colorado also took a number of actions to prioritize funding programs and initiatives that delivered results. In 2014, the state partnered with the Pew Results First Initiative to leverage a cost-benefit model to assess programs in the areas of adult criminal justice, juvenile justice, and child welfare. This cost-benefit analysis identified 24 programs with positive returns on investment as well as nine programs with more costs than benefits. (These nine programs were reassessed so they could be improved.) Building on these efforts, in 2018, the Governor’s Office and the legislature passed legislation to create three child welfare <a href="http://www.americaforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PFS-OSPB-initiative-one-pager-April-2018-Signing-Ceremony.pdf">Pay for Success initiatives</a>.

Concurrent Enrollment programs allow students to do just this by earning college-level credit while in high school. Motivated by the strong <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ961443">evidence</a> of the success of these programs, the state rapidly expanded Concurrent Enrollment opportunities. Nearly 46,000 students <a href="https://highered.colorado.gov/Publications/Reports/Enrollment/FY2018/2018_Concurrent_Enrollment_April_2019.pdf">participated in these programs in 2018</a>, up 10% from the previous year, representing nearly one-third of all juniors and seniors who attend public high schools in Colorado.</p><p>The effort to promote and grow Concurrent Enrollment in Colorado is a comprehensive example of the state’s use of the Blueprint’s Strategies to deliver results. Governor Polis is managing for results by supporting the <a href="http://masterplan.highered.colorado.gov/the-colorado-goal-66-percent-statewide-attainment/">statewide target</a> set by the state’s Commission on Higher Education of 66% postsecondary credential attainment among adults ages 25 to 34 by 2025. Governor Polis included this statewide target on his Governor’s Dashboard, with Concurrent Enrollment as a <a href="https://dashboard.state.co.us/bold4-education-workforce.htm">key strategy</a> to get there, with its own specific target metrics.</p><p>Recognizing the need to leverage data to make the case for the expansion of Concurrent Enrollment, the Colorado Department of Higher Education worked with the Colorado Department of Education to combine data (in a way that preserved student privacy) so that the effectiveness of the program could be measured. Agency leadership, as well as staff focused on data management and evaluation within them, enabled the agencies to bring expertise in research- and evidence-based methods.</p><p>The Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab was enlisted to help build and use the evidence needed to understand if the program was working. A <a href="https://coloradolab.org/ies-concurrent-enrollment/">causal study</a> was conducted, which followed five cohorts of 11th grade students who attended a state secondary school from the 2009-2010 school year through the 2015-2016 school year. The results were encouraging. The study found that, even with special attention to low-income and minority family outcomes, the probability of enrolling in college within one year of expected high school graduation was 77% for students who participated in Concurrent Enrollment, versus 52% for those who did not; the probability of persisting into a second year of college was 82% versus 77%, respectively. In 2020, the Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab is using <a href="https://coloradolab.org/concurrent-enrollment-and-labor/">rigorous methods to evaluate</a> if Concurrent Enrollment improves time-to-degree and wages for participants.</p><p>Governor Polis then invested in results by <a href="https://highered.colorado.gov/Publications/Reports/Enrollment/FY2018/2018_Concurrent_Enrollment_April_2019.pdf">citing</a> the evidence of Concurrent Enrollment’s effectiveness as a key reason to scale the program further through “smart policy tweaks and investments this year and in the years to come.” This led to a <a href="https://co.chalkbeat.org/2019/11/1/21109160/colorado-gov-polis-calls-for-6-000-more-state-funded-preschool-spots-in-2020-budget-request">direct request</a> for a $500,000 increase in funding for Concurrent Enrollment programs for the FY 2020-21 budget cycle, meant to accelerate the governor’s goal of improving the affordability of a postsecondary credential.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="accordion-row row align-center"><div class="column large-12 markdown"><button class="accordion"><h5>How to Use the Blueprint for Delivering Results in Government</h5><i class="fa fa-plus fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><div class="panel"><p>The Blueprint contains Strategies -- and specific accompanying Actions -- that provide a practical way for state governments to more effectively achieve results by increasing their evidence and data capacity. However, it is worth noting that this capacity building is an iterative process and that each state’s process will not necessarily be linear. As such, to help state leaders identify the necessary resources for each Action, the Blueprint denotes which of the following common levers is associated with the implementation of the Action:</p><div class="media-object" style="justify-content:left"><div class="media-object-section"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="accordion-lever" alt="People" src="/rfa-blueprint-2020/images/People.png"></div></div><div class="media-object-section main-section"><h5>People</h5></div></div><p>People are the backbone of state government. To effectively invest in what works, state governments need both strong leadership (with the right talent in the right positions) and broad adoption of data and evidence by staff at all levels. By building capacity from leadership to frontline staff, state governments can create a true evidence-based culture that achieves better results.</p><div class="media-object" style="justify-content:left"><div class="media-object-section"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="accordion-lever" alt="Policies" src="/rfa-blueprint-2020/images/Policies.png"></div></div><div class="media-object-section main-section"><h5>Policy</h5></div></div><p>Policies drive action in state government. In order to execute activities consistently and effectively, state governments need clear policies that are appropriately communicated across stakeholder communities. Clear policies on data and evidence can align people around common goals and precipitate the appropriate infrastructure needed to support progress.</p><div class="media-object" style="justify-content:left"><div class="media-object-section"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="accordion-lever" alt="Infrastructure" src="/rfa-blueprint-2020/images/Infrastructure.png"></div></div><div class="media-object-section main-section"><h5>Infrastructure</h5></div></div><p>Appropriate systems, structures, and tools allow state government employees to fully carry out their responsibilities.

Through a series of in-depth, facilitated learning sessions in 2019 and 2020, senior staff from more than a dozen governors offices contributed their expertise to developing this Blueprint. As such, this Blueprint is a practical guide that reflects the collective experience of many of the country’s most effective state government leaders.</p></div><button class="accordion"><h5>Examples of Prioritizing Evidence of Effectiveness in Government Grant Programs</h5><i class="fa fa-plus fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><div class="panel"><p>This table provides specific examples of how governments have prioritized evidence of effectiveness in their grantmaking decisions.
