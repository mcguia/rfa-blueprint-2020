    1. [Strategic goals](https://2019state.results4america.org/state-standard-of-excellence/strategic-goals.html)
    2. [Performance management/continuous improvement](https://2019state.results4america.org/state-standard-of-excellence/performance-management--continuous-improvement.html)
  rationale: "Managing performance starts with understanding how the governor’s administration
    defines success and builds the overarching system and culture to deliver that
    success. Without a set of goals and metrics, or strategic plans, to define the
    administration’s agenda, it is difficult to communicate to staff within the agencies
    or the general public what the government aims to deliver.\n\n\nAn integrated
    system for reviewing performance goals and connecting decision-making across the
    major activities in an administration greatly increases the chances that key goals
    and metrics will be achieved, especially across issue areas that extend beyond
    traditional government agency and department siloes. Performance management helps
    state governments improve customer service, program performance, and outcomes
    for their residents. This use of data to set goals and monitor performance can
    be an especially powerful way to improve equity by focusing efforts on disadvantaged
    populations. Further this transparency with the public and stakeholders places
    the focus on results, rather than process. This emphasis on results is difficult
    to sustain without a culture centered on data-driven and evidence-based policymaking.
    Policies and goals can be changed over time, but a state government culture that
    prioritizes the use of data and evidence to deliver better results for residents
    creates lasting impact. "

  rationale: |
    The key to improving performance in government is to leverage data to inform goals, measure progress, and learn lessons for future improvement. Appropriate frameworks and talent (as well as easy ways to align and share data) make it possible to comprehensively use data for improvement, research, and evaluation.


    This kind of data use allows the building of knowledge about what works, for whom, and why in ways that can allow governments to identify and reduce the systemic barriers that produce inequality. In this way, governments have demonstrated the power of unleashing administrative data, often supported through improved data linking and sharing. While the technical components of linking data with the appropriate privacy measures are absolutely paramount, qualified and empowered personnel play a critical role in helping agencies leverage data to improve decisions while building a data-centric culture across the state.

  rationale: |-
    Data is a key tool for performance management but it can also play a valuable role in building longer term evidence about interventions that achieve the best outcomes. In order to take full advantage of data, it is important to have the evaluation infrastructure that allows empirical evidence to inform an administration’s budget, management, and policy decisions.


    “Knowing what works” in a particular context (and what to fund) requires research and evaluation capacity both within and outside of government. Research and evaluation offices can conduct evaluations, build lasting collaborative research partnerships, and provide expertise on high-quality evidence-building activities. At their best, these evaluation offices engage residents to identify key priorities, especially how governments can build and use evidence to improve equity. Funding these capacities is essential and can be done through set asides, carve outs in program funds, and even budget line items. Embedding research infrastructure in government that is aligned with budgeting processes allows states to move towards results-focused spending.

    - Create learning agendas (statewide and at agencies)
    - Develop an evaluation policy aligned with evidence definitions (see Minnesota Management and Budget’s evaluation policy)
    - Build relationships with institutions and organizations that can provide external research capacity (such as the research-practice partnership model of the Tennessee Education Research Alliance)
    - Make evidence and evaluations publicly available through a clearinghouse or inventory (such as the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare)
  long_term_wins: |-
    - Create a strong state evaluation culture with centralized, agency, and external capacity (see State Education Agencies in Mississippi, Ohio, and Massachusetts, which have created research and evaluation offices to lead and coordinate evaluation activities)

    11. Cost-benefit analysis
    12. Use of evidence in grant programs
    13. Innovation
    14. Contracting for outcomes
    15. Repurpose for results
  rationale: "Government spending is policy in action. Incorporating evidence and
    data into these spending decisions is the best way for state governments to make
    improvements over the status quo, which too often reinforces historical inequality.\n\nRather
    than making spending decisions based on assumptions and hunches, leaders and policymakers
    should spend resources on programs, interventions, and services that have evidence
    of effectiveness. To improve results, government should shift public resources
    to the most effective interventions in order to increase their scale and impact.
    \n\nThere are a range of tools for making government spending more evidence-based,
    from legislatively mandating public spending on evidence-based interventions to
    using outcome-focused contracts. These tools can be used across state government
    to shift funding away from strategies that fail to deliver the desired outcomes
    and toward evidence-based interventions that achieve better results for state
    residents. "
