      facilitates the linkage, storage, and analysis of administrative data. By linking

      accounted for only 1.6% of births statewide but 50% of infant deaths, and that
      inadequate access to prenatal care accounted for 65% of infant deaths. This
      information drove increased investment in a targeted strategy to identify those
      at-risk and connect them with vital resources to reduce infant mortality. As
      a result, infant mortality rate decreased significantly from 2017 to 2018 and
