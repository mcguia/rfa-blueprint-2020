    description: |-
      To meet the [governor’s goal](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/15/indiana-state-of-the-state-gov-eric-holcomb-2020-speech-annotated/4432905002/) of having the lowest infant mortality rate in the Midwest, Indiana leveraged its [Management Performance Hub](https://www.in.gov/mph/), which facilitates the linkage, storage, and analysis of administrative data. By linking data across 17 data sets, Management Performance Hub staff were able to better [understand and map mortality rates](http://www.govtech.com/health/Indiana-Uses-Data-Analytics-to-Lower-Infant-Mortality-Child-Fatality.html), discovering that the infant mortality rate in Indiana is 7.3%, compared to the national rate of 5.8%, which accounts for 602 babies dying before their first birthdays in the state. This information drove increased investment in a targeted strategy to identify those at risk and connect them with vital resources to reduce infant mortality through an [innovative program](https://www.in.gov/isdh/28233.htm) focused on building a network of wraparound services for mothers and infants.  As a result, infant mortality rate [decreased significantly](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/15/indiana-state-of-the-state-gov-eric-holcomb-2020-speech-annotated/4432905002/) from 2017 to 2018 and is at its lowest since 2012. By 2019, the initiative had linked 44 de-identified maternal and infant health mortality data sets.
