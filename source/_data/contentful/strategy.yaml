      rate in the Midwest, Indiana leveraged its Management Performance Hub, which
      facilitates the linkage, storage, and analysis of administrative data. By linking
      data across 17 data sets, Management Performance Hub staff were able to better
      understand and map mortality rates, discovering that a single high-risk subpopulation
      accounted for only 1.6% of births statewide but 50% of infant deaths, and that
      inadequate access to prenatal care accounted for 65% of infant deaths. This
      information drove increased investment in a targeted strategy to identify those
      at-risk and connect them with vital resources to reduce infant mortality. As
      a result, infant mortality rate decreased significantly from 2017 to 2018 and
