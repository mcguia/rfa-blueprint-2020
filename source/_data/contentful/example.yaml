  description: "To meet the governor’s goal of having the lowest infant mortality
    rate in the Midwest, Indiana leveraged its Management Performance Hub, which facilitates
    the linkage, storage, and analysis of administrative data. By linking data across
    17 data sets, Management Performance Hub staff were able to better understand
    and map mortality rates, discovering that a single high-risk subpopulation accounted
    for only 1.6% of births statewide but 50% of infant deaths, and that inadequate
    access to prenatal care accounted for 65% of infant deaths. This information drove
    increased investment in a targeted strategy to identify those at-risk and connect
    them with vital resources to reduce infant mortality. As a result, infant mortality
    rate decreased significantly from 2017 to 2018 and is at its lowest since 2012.
