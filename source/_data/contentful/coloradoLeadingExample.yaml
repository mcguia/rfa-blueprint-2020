  description: "Of special note, Investing for Results is the most important Blueprint
    Theme for state government leaders. Spending is where the “rubber meets the road”
    -- the point at which governments allocate public resources to deliver services
    and programs. Using the Strategies in this Blueprint will help state leaders shift
    away from making spending decisions based on assumptions and towards spending
    resources on activities that have (or are building) evidence of effectiveness.
    As illustrated in the Colorado example below, shifting resources is a difficult,
    but necessary, step to truly achieve the best possible results both in government
    and for customers. \n"

  themes_overview: 'For over a decade, Colorado’s state government has been a leader
    in using data and evidence to improve its results (including being [recognized](https://results4america.org/press-releases/results-for-america-releases-2019-invest-in-what-works-state-standard-of-excellence/)
    as a Leading State in the 2019 State Standard of Excellence). During this time,
    the state implemented many of the Blueprint Strategies, illustrating how evidence-based
    policymaking can improve results in the area of economic opportunity. '
  mfr: 'Colorado launched a public dashboard in 2016, with customer-oriented metrics
    that cascaded down to agency operations through [departmental strategic plans](https://operations.colorado.gov/department-performance-plans).
    Leveraging both lead and lag metrics, the state reviewed its performance quarterly
    at the cabinet level, which informed cross-department collaboration on major initiatives.
    This effort was launched by the state’s first Chief Performance Officer, appointed
    in 2015, and expanded that same year when the new Lieutenant Governor assumed
    role of Chief Operating Officer with operational responsibility for a state government
    budget of more than $30 billion and a 30,000 person workforce. Over three years,
    the state improved on 85% of its metrics and hit the target on 55%. For example,
    as noted in the Governor’s November 2018 budget request, the state expanded broadband
    connectivity for school districts from 74% in 2015 to 98% in 2018, lowered the
    healthcare uninsured rate from 14% in 2013 to 6.5% in 2017, and cut or modified
    half of the state’s 24,500 regulations, delivering more than $7.9 million in cost
    avoidance and 2.3 million in hours saved for Colorado businesses in 2017. Given
    the success of these efforts, the [public dashboard](https://dashboard.state.co.us/)
    was maintained across a change in Administration in 2019. The state also established
    [process improvement resources and teams](https://coloradolab.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Report-5-Lean-Process-Improvement.11.1.19.pdf)
    that led to the completion of nearly 900 projects over seven years, touching every
    state agency. These efforts combined to promote a statewide culture of delivering
    results for the customer. '
  ld: 'In 2009, Colorado hired the country’s first state government Chief Data Officer
    (CDO) to create an enterprise-wide vision for data usage in support of service
    delivery. The CDO chaired the statewide [Government Data Advisory Board](http://www.oit.state.co.us/cto/cim/government-data-advisory-board)
    that created a statewide data integration service, which allowed for interoperability
    of data assets among state entities. The state also established a [training academy](https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/performance-management-academy)
    in 2013 to support staff in using data-driven methods to improve outcomes across
    all agencies. More than 500 state leaders completed the training, which included
    topics on using metrics and data-based methods to deliver results; the training
    regularly received a 50%+ net promoter score. '
  bue: 'In 2017, the state created the [Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab](https://coloradolab.org/)
    as a strategic research partner for government agencies and a bridge to the research
    community. In one of many efforts, the Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab and
    the Governor’s Office co-designed the [Linked Information Network of Colorado](https://coloradolab.org/linc/)
    (LINC) to facilitate data sharing for research and analysis purposes to drive
    improvement in state policies and programs. During this period, the Governor’s
    Office of State Planning and Budgeting increased the use of data and evidence
    in budget decisions by [requiring agencies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0TNL0CtD9wXOXozbkMzUlZwZHc/view)
    to include the following in their budget requests: evidence of program effectiveness,
    alignment with the Governor’s dashboard metrics, and if they had been the focus
    of a process improvement project. The Governor’s Office of State Planning and
    Budgeting has partnered with state agencies, academic and philanthropic organizations,
    and the state legislature’s Joint Budget Committee as part of an [Evidence-Based
    Policy Collaborative](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/ebp_12-11-2018.pdf)
    to “use the best available research and information to help guide and inform policy
    and budget decisions” for the state’s budget of more than $30 billion. '
  ifr: Colorado also took a number of actions to prioritize funding programs and initiatives
    that delivered results. In 2014, the state partnered with the Pew Results First
    Initiative to leverage a cost-benefit model to assess programs in the areas of
    adult criminal justice, juvenile justice, and child welfare. This cost-benefit
    analysis identified 24 programs with positive returns on investment as well as
    nine programs with more costs than benefits. (These nine programs were reassessed
    so they could be improved.) Building on these efforts, in 2018, the Governor’s
    Office and the legislature passed legislation to create three child welfare [Pay
    for Success initiatives](http://www.americaforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PFS-OSPB-initiative-one-pager-April-2018-Signing-Ceremony.pdf).
    Funded with $6 million, these projects aimed to return $15 million in savings
    to taxpayers and society.
  pulling_it_all_together: "State policymakers believe that to prepare all students
    for a rapidly changing world, they must continue to make stronger connections
    across the traditional silos of K-12 education, higher education, and employment.
    Concurrent Enrollment programs allow students to do just this by earning college-level
    credit while in high school. Motivated by the strong [evidence](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ961443)
    of the success of these programs, the state rapidly expanded Concurrent Enrollment
    opportunities. Nearly 46,000 students [participated in these programs in 2018](https://highered.colorado.gov/Publications/Reports/Enrollment/FY2018/2018_Concurrent_Enrollment_April_2019.pdf),
    up 10% from the previous year, representing nearly one-third of all juniors and
    seniors who attend public high schools in Colorado. \n \nThe effort to promote
    and grow Concurrent Enrollment in Colorado is a comprehensive example of the state’s
    use of the Blueprint’s Strategies to deliver results. Governor Polis is managing
    for results by supporting the [statewide target](http://masterplan.highered.colorado.gov/the-colorado-goal-66-percent-statewide-attainment/)
    set by the state’s Commission on Higher Education of 66% postsecondary credential
    attainment among adults ages 25 to 34 by 2025. Governor Polis included this statewide
    target on his Governor’s Dashboard, with Concurrent Enrollment as a [key strategy](https://dashboard.state.co.us/bold4-education-workforce.htm)
    to get there, with its own specific target metrics. \n \nRecognizing the need
    to leverage data to make the case for the expansion of Concurrent Enrollment,
    the Colorado Department of Higher Education worked with the Colorado Department
    of Education to combine data (in a way that preserved student privacy) so that
    the effectiveness of the program could be measured. Agency leadership, as well
    as staff focused on data management and evaluation within them, enabled the agencies
    to bring expertise in research- and evidence-based methods.\n\nThe Colorado Evaluation
    and Action Lab was enlisted to help build and use the evidence needed to understand
    if the program was working. A [causal study](https://coloradolab.org/ies-concurrent-enrollment/)
    was conducted, which followed five cohorts of 11th grade students who attended
    a state secondary school from the 2009-2010 school year through the 2015-2016
    school year. The results were encouraging. The study found that, even with special
    attention to low-income and minority family outcomes, the probability of enrolling
    in college within one year of expected high school graduation was 77% for students
    who participated in Concurrent Enrollment, versus 52% for those who did not; the
    probability of persisting into a second year of college was 82% versus 77%, respectively.
    In 2020, the Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab is using [rigorous methods to
    evaluate](https://coloradolab.org/concurrent-enrollment-and-labor/) if Concurrent
    Enrollment improves time-to-degree and wages for participants.\n \nGovernor Polis
    then invested in results by [citing](https://highered.colorado.gov/Publications/Reports/Enrollment/FY2018/2018_Concurrent_Enrollment_April_2019.pdf)
    the evidence of Concurrent Enrollment’s effectiveness as a key reason to scale
    the program further through “smart policy tweaks and investments this year and
    in the years to come.” This led to a [direct request](https://co.chalkbeat.org/2019/11/1/21109160/colorado-gov-polis-calls-for-6-000-more-state-funded-preschool-spots-in-2020-budget-request)
    for a $500,000 increase in funding for Concurrent Enrollment programs for the
    FY 2020-21 budget cycle, meant to accelerate the governor’s goal of improving
    the affordability of a postsecondary credential."
