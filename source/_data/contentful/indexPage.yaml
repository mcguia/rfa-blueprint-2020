  overview: "The Results for *America’s Blueprint for Delivering Results in State
    Government* is designed to provide state government leaders with the information
    they need to incorporate evidence and data into their state’s most critical budget,
    policy, and management decisions. The Blueprint is based on the idea that evidence
    and data can be key tools in helping governments deliver equitable outcomes for
    residents in states across the country. \n\nThis Blueprint is an implementation
    guide for Results for America’s [Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence](https://2019state.results4america.org/)
    (State Standard of Excellence). The State Standard of Excellence sets a national
    benchmark for how state governments can use evidence and data to achieve improved
    outcomes for their residents, whereas the Blueprint for Delivering Results in
    State Government (Blueprint) provides state governments with specific implementation
    strategies and actions for consistently and effectively using evidence and data
    to get better results..\n\nTaken together, the State Standard of Excellence and
    Blueprint provide state governments with a set of comprehensive resources to:"

      [2. Performance management / continuous improvement](https://2019state.results4america.org/state-standard-of-excellence/performance-management--continuous-improvement.html)
    rationale: "Managing performance starts with understanding how the governor’s
      administration defines success and builds the overarching system and culture
      to deliver that success. Without a set of goals and metrics (or strategic plans)
      to define the administration’s agenda, it is difficult to communicate to staff
      within the agencies or the general public what the government aims to deliver.\n\n\nAn
      integrated system for reviewing performance goals and connecting decision-making
      across the major activities in an administration greatly increases the chances
      that key goals and metrics will be achieved, especially across issue areas that
      extend beyond traditional government agency and department siloes. Performance
      management helps state governments improve customer service, program performance,
      and outcomes for their residents. This use of data to set goals and monitor
      performance can be an especially powerful way to improve equity by focusing
      efforts on communities of color. Further, transparency with the public and stakeholders
      places the focus on results, rather than process. This emphasis on results is
      difficult to sustain without a culture centered on data-driven and evidence-based
      policymaking. Policies and goals can be changed over time, but a state government
      culture that prioritizes the use of data and evidence to deliver better results
      for residents creates lasting impact. "

      The key to improving performance in government is to leverage data to inform goals, measure progress, and learn lessons for future improvement. Appropriate frameworks, easy ways to align data, and talent make it possible to comprehensively use data for improvement, research, and evaluation.


      This type of data use creates the foundation of knowledge about what works, for whom, and why in ways that can allow governments to identify and reduce the systemic barriers that produce inequality. In this manner, governments have demonstrated the power of unleashing administrative data, often supported through improved data linking and sharing. While the technical components of linking data with the appropriate privacy measures are absolutely paramount, qualified and empowered personnel play a critical role in helping agencies leverage data to improve decisions while building a data-centric culture across the state.

    rationale: |-
      Data is a key tool for performance management but it can also play a valuable role in building longer term evidence about interventions that achieve the best outcomes. In order to take full advantage of data, it is important to have the evaluation infrastructure that allows empirical evidence to inform an administration’s budget, management, and policy decisions.


      “Knowing what works” in a particular context (and what to fund) requires research and evaluation capacity both within and outside of government. Research and evaluation offices can conduct evaluations, build lasting collaborative research partnerships, and provide expertise on high-quality evidence-building activities. At their best, these evaluation offices engage residents to identify key priorities, especially how governments can build and use evidence to improve equity. Funding these capacities is essential and can be done through set asides, carve-outs in program funds, and even budget line items. Embedding research infrastructure in government that is aligned with budgeting processes allows states to move towards results-focused spending.

    worth noting that this capacity building is an iterative process and that each
    state’s process will not necessarily be linear. As such, to help state leaders
    identify the necessary resources for each Action, the Blueprint denotes which
    of the following common levers is associated with the implementation of the Action:'
  people: People are the backbone of state government. To effectively invest in what
    works, state governments need both strong leadership (with the right talent in
    the right positions) and broad adoption of data and evidence by staff at all levels.
    By building capacity from leadership to frontline staff, state governments can
    create a true evidence-based culture that achieves better results.
  policy: Policy drives action in state government. In order to execute activities
    consistently and effectively, state governments need clear policies that are appropriately
    communicated across stakeholder communities. Clear policies on data and evidence
    can align people around common goals and precipitate the appropriate infrastructure
    needed to support progress.
  infrastructure: Appropriate systems, structures, and tools allow state government
    employees to fully carry out their responsibilities. Infrastructure can be key
    for increasing *and* sustaining evidence-based policy capacity through means such
    as data systems, governance structures, and evaluation tools.
  blueprint_development: The Blueprint was developed with the assistance of senior
    staff from a bipartisan group of governors offices as part of the [What Works
    Bootcamps](https://results4america.org/what-works-bootcamps/) training series
    hosted by Results for America and the National Governors Association to help advance
    evidence-based policymaking in state governments. Through a series of in-depth,
    facilitated learning sessions in 2019 and 2020, senior staff from more than a
    dozen governors offices contributed their expertise to developing this Blueprint.
    As such, this Blueprint is a practical guide that reflects the collective experience
    of many of the country’s most effective state government leaders.
  examples_of_prioritizing: "[This table](http://assets.ctfassets.net/xrxa0m8bxqnj/3d13siTYAhsepkWWewBqtT/46b7dd7c81210fbb92740136c5cfbb95/Prioritizing_Evidence_of_Effectiveness_chart_July_2020.pdf)
    provides specific examples of how governments have prioritized evidence of effectiveness
    in their grantmaking decisions. Using evidence of effectiveness means shifting
    taxpayer dollars to programs that have been proven to be effective through strong
    evaluations or based on their past performance. \n\nOf note, the term “grant programs”
    as used below includes all types of government spending on human services programs,
    including grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other programmatic expenditures."
  conclusion: |-
    The shift from “business as usual” to delivering real results is an iterative process that requires strong leadership and intentional action to build a culture of data and evidence use. The strategies outlined in this Blueprint allow state governments to build the infrastructure and capacity they need to become learning organizations that continuously work to improve results. This detailed implementation guide demonstrates how governors and their staff can consistently use evidence and data in budget, policy, and management decisions to achieve improved outcomes for their residents.

    Above all, this Blueprint equips state leaders to make better decisions to effectively and equitably spend state funds. By providing Strategies, Actions, and tools to use evidence in state budgeting and spending decisions, this Blueprint offers state governments a guide for investing in what works and for becoming models of excellence like those described in Results for America’s *[Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence](https://2019state.results4america.org/)*. Ultimately, the effective use of state funds to achieve desired outcomes for state residents is the best measure of whether a governor achieves results.
