  overview: |-
    This *Blueprint for Delivering Results in State Government* is an implementation guide for Results for America’s [Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence](https://2019state.results4america.org/) (State Standard). The State Standard sets a national standard for how state governments can use evidence and data to achieve better outcomes for their residents whereas the *Blueprint for Delivering Results in State Government* (Blueprint) provides state governments with specific implementation strategies and actions for consistently and effectively using evidence and data in budget, policy, and management decisions.


    Taken together, the State Standard and Blueprint provide state governments with a set of comprehensive resources to:
    - __Identify a high level roadmap__ to [assess](https://2019state.results4america.org/downloads.html) where they can increase their capacity to use evidence and data in their decision-making;
    - __Implement detailed strategies__ to build this capacity to foster and sustain an organizational culture focused on learning and results; and
    - __Improve investments__ by using their evidence and data capacity to spend taxpayer dollars on evidence-based solutions that achieve better results for their residents


    This Blueprint is designed for state government leaders in governors offices, state budget and policy offices, and within state agencies who are charged with making their state’s critical budget, policy, and management decisions. The Blueprint describes specific strategies, actions, resources, and examples of leading practices to help state governments achieve excellence in the State Standard and better outcomes for their residents.
  summary_of_strategies: "*The Blueprint is organized into the following Blueprint
    Themes, each of which has accompanying Strategies that are aligned to specific
    criteria in the State Standard. The Blueprint also recommends a series of accompanying
    Actions for each of these Strategies and provides examples of how state governments
    have implemented these approaches.*"

    title: Managing for Results
    order: 1
    related_criteria: |-
      1. [Strategic goals](https://2019state.results4america.org/state-standard-of-excellence/strategic-goals.html)
      2. [Performance management/continuous improvement](https://2019state.results4america.org/state-standard-of-excellence/performance-management--continuous-improvement.html)
    rationale: 'Managing performance starts with understanding how the governor’s
      administration defines success and builds the overarching system and culture
      to deliver that success. Without a set of goals and metrics, or strategic plans,
      to define the administration’s agenda, it is difficult to communicate to staff
      within the agencies or the general public what the government aims to deliver.
      An integrated system for reviewing performance goals and connecting decision-making
      across the major activities in an administration greatly increases the chances
      that key goals and metrics will be achieved, especially across issue areas that
      extend beyond traditional government agency and department siloes. Performance
      management helps state governments improve customer service, program performance,
      and outcomes for their residents. This use of data to set goals and monitor
      performance can be an especially powerful way to improve equity by focusing
      efforts on disadvantaged populations. Further this transparency with the public
      and stakeholders places the focus on results, rather than process. This emphasis
      on results is difficult to sustain without a culture centered on data-driven
      and evidence-based policymaking. Policies and goals can be changed over time,
      but a state government culture that prioritizes the use of data and evidence
      to deliver better results for residents creates lasting impact. '

    wins_description: "*By following the actions above and building over time, states
      should aim to achieve wins along the way to galvanize internal and external
      support. Here are some sample wins, though there are many other types of achievements
      that states could use to mark their progress.*"
    quick_wins: |-
      - Hire/designate a Chief Performance Officer to ensure the governor’s goals are results-driven with metrics, outcomes, and deliverables (such as [Connecticut’s Chief Performance Officer](https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2019/04-2019/Governor-Lamont-Launches-Statewide-Performance-and-Results-Agenda))
      - Create a public dashboard to show progress toward meeting strategic goals (see [Colorado Governor’s Dashboard](https://dashboard.state.co.us/default.htm))
      - Identify and engage key agency leaders in statewide performance management and align agency goals with dashboard
    mid_term_wins: "- Build a performance team to support a cross-agency performance
      management system for strategic goals \n- Ensure statewide strategic and performance
      goals are reflected in agencies’ work (see Colorado's Department of Human Services’s
      [C-Stat](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdhs/c-stat))\n- [Highlight](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/11/john-hickenlooper-colorado-state-of-state-text/)
      important wins publicly and internally to emphasize progress made toward accomplishing
      goals"
    long_term_wins: |-
      - Normalize performance management and strategic planning through executive action (see the executive order that established [Results Washington](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/eo_13-04.pdf))
      - Leverage the annual budget process to align governor’s priorities with budget development (such as the Colorado [State Measurement for Accountability, Responsive, and Transparent Government Act](https://operations.colorado.gov/performance-management#https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Zk7X2XyM4nhv2CjOtcyWJflcxL74JjN/view))
      - Convene leadership and performance teams for regular public stat meetings (such as Results Washington [Results Reviews](https://results.wa.gov/measuring-progress/results-reviews))
      - Leverage performance management data and continuous improvement insights to inform research and learning agendas

  conclusion: |-
    The shift from “business as usual” to delivering real results is an iterative process that requires strong leadership and intentional action to build a culture of data and evidence use. The strategies outlined in this Blueprint allow state governments to build the infrastructure and capacity they need to become learning organizations that continuously work to improve results. This detailed implementation guide demonstrates how governors and their staff can consistently and effectively use evidence and data in budget, policy, and management decisions to achieve improved outcomes for their residents.

    Above all, this Blueprint equips state leaders to make better decisions to effectively and equitably spend state funds. By providing strategies, actions, and tools to use evidence in state budgeting and spending decisions, this Blueprint offers state governments a guide for investing in what works and for becoming models of excellence like those described in Results for America’s *[Invest in What Works State Standard of Excellence](https://2019state.results4america.org/)*. Ultimately, the effective use of state funds to achieve desired outcomes for state residents is the best measure of how an effective governor achieves results.
